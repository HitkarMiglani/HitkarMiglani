## About ME

I am a tech lover and a future AI engineer at Chitkara University still. As of now, I am a student who has been eager to understand the concept known as Artificial Intelligence. Based on my knowledge in this area I feel that I can apply what I have learnt in areas such as; Machine learning, Deep learning, and Neural networks to come up with new solutions.

Besides the school assignments, I enjoy developing solutions for open-source artificial intelligence projects on GitHub. Preferably, I am in search of individuals with whom I could collaborate to create new concepts that would integrate the application of artificial intelligence into new ideas and schemes. My intent when I think about artificial intelligence it is more along the lines of how do I make AI available to more people, how do I make sure people have more time because time is a separating factor today than money so that they can do more meaningful work, or how to take data and utilize it in a much more effective manner?

For individual hiring on GitHub, you will find that worked on TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and OpenCV among others to create a Face Emotion Recognion Model with almost 80% accuracy based on FER2013 training dataset. I also have a few small invests in the NLP and recommender system. I will also do other projects in the process of my learning therefore those projects might have more of what I have learned.

If you have any other active AI projects that are open source or you are still seeking more enthusiasts to join, I will be happy to join! Especially, I am eager to enhance my professional knowledge more actively in such environment cooperating with peers, other developers and engineers. I am leaning new skills on Coursera.

ThankYou
