My name is Hitkar Miglani, and I hail from Yamunanagar, Haryana which is well known for its unique culture. 
I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degreee i.e. B.E in CSE with specialization in AI from the renowned institute ,Chitkara University , Rajpura , Punjab . 
I am a humble being with professional, ethical and technical skills all in one. 
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is what I admire, and so keeping a check on my outfit, physical appearance and health is of utmost priority to me. My interests include, researching, analysing and learning the unexplored aspect of topics. 
I've successfully learnt various technical skills and designing techniques. 
I also have a hobby of web surfing about a certain topic or field. 
Mostly in free time I prefer to read a book or to solve a puzzle like Sudoku .
Patience, curiosity and keen observation alongside dedication towards tasks are my key skills. 
I am a kind hearted person who is always ready to help, optimistic , workaholic, good listener and obviously a music lover . 
My recent participation in various workshops conducted and online certified courses have not only complimented my problem solving skills but have also boosted my confidence.
My greatest asset is my mental capability & my will to not give up. I am always in search of something new to learn. As a life goal, I would love to see myself as a successful and distinguished executive.

That's all about me.
